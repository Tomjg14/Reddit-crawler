# Reddit-crawler

This blog will describe how to collect comments from Reddit and how to work with those comments to perform sentiment analysis. The comments were collected as part of a master thesis and were not made publicly available.

This blog contains the following sections:
* [The Data](#the-data)
* [Crawling](#crawling)
* [Preprocessing](#preprocessing)
